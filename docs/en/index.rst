slime Documentation
====================

slime is an LLM post-training framework for RL scaling, providing two core capabilities:

- High-Performance Training: Supports efficient training in various modes by connecting Megatron with SGLang;
- Flexible Data Generation: Enables arbitrary training data generation workflows through custom data generation interfaces and server-based engines.

slime's design goal is to make these two capabilities reinforce each other without turning the system into a heavy stack of disconnected trainers, rollout services, and agent frameworks. Megatron training, SGLang rollout, custom data generation, reward computation, verifier feedback, and environment interaction all flow through the same training / rollout / Data Buffer path.

This makes slime one of the most battle-tested open RL post-training frameworks: small enough to understand and extend, but validated through complete training loops behind SOTA-level model releases.

Why This Design Matters
-----------------------

- **Battle-tested by frontier model training**: slime is the RL framework behind `GLM-5.1 <https://z.ai/blog/glm-5.1>`_, `GLM-5 <https://z.ai/blog/glm-5>`_, `GLM-4.7 <https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.7>`_, `GLM-4.6 <https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6>`_, and `GLM-4.5 <https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5>`_.
- **Native by design**: slime passes Megatron arguments through directly and exposes installed SGLang arguments with a ``--sglang-`` prefix, so upstream training and serving optimizations remain available without adding another wrapper layer.
- **SGLang-focused rollout**: slime chooses one rollout backend intentionally. This avoids flattening multiple inference engines into a lowest-common-denominator abstraction and lets RL workloads use SGLang-specific serving, routing, caching, disaggregation, and weight-sync behavior directly.
- **Agentic workflows as data generation**: tool use, sandbox interaction, verifier rewards, environment feedback, multi-agent loops, and long-horizon agentic workflows plug into the same training / rollout / Data Buffer path instead of forking the training kernel.
- **BF16 training with FP8 rollout**: large MoE recipes use Megatron BF16 training state with SGLang FP8 rollout/inference; long-context rollout can also use ``--sglang-kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3`` to increase effective KV cache capacity.
- **Tested as RL infrastructure**: CPU correctness tests run automatically, while GPU e2e tests cover real Megatron + SGLang training/rollout paths, including dense/MoE recipes, async rollout, SGLang config, checkpointing, precision, and debug replay. See :doc:`developer_guide/ci`.

Production Validation
---------------------

Beyond the GLM family, slime also supports:

- Qwen series (Qwen3.6, Qwen3.5, Qwen3Next, Qwen3MoE, Qwen3, Qwen2.5);
- DeepSeek V3 series (DeepSeek V3, V3.1, DeepSeek R1);
- Llama 3.
